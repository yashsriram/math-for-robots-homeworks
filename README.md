# robotmath-hws

## description
- Few problems on robot math.
- And crisp solutions to them.
- As part of CSCI 5551 - Introduction to Robotics course at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

## code
- Each `hw*/` contains some problems.
- Solutions are written in `Latex`.

## usage
- Use any Latex compiler to compile solutions tex file into pdf.
- `latekmk` is a good one.

## roadmap
- Problems in `hw*/` are solved.
